# WELCOME TO MY FIRST MILESTONE PROJECT!

## Jonathan Howells Resume

I decided to create a resume website for a number of reasons. One being that I wanted to create something that I might use in the real world
in my future life, to design a structure that is beautiful, concise and efficent in showcasing my code. Another that it would help me understand
what making design choices meant, what lengths I would have to go to achieve something that I was happy with, something I would want to show
people that could be potential employers or collaboraters. Of course currently I cannot complete some of the pages to be able to publically host this 
website, for example the portfolio page, it is meant to showcase what work I have been apart of or created. Currently I dont have any work bar this
that I have worked on. So instead there are a number of placeholder websites. But in the future this could well become a good starting point for my own
proffessional website. 

I really enjoyed making hard design choices and pushing myself as hard as I could to create some of the features. It was also very interesting
exploring all the different ways you can achieve certain layouts etc. From really inefficent code that has lots of different custom CSS styling, to more
concise and robust CSS using bootstrap with some custom CSS. I tried to combine the two to make it unique but also showcase that I am comfortable 
using frameworks to their full potential. 

## UX

My main design choices and features were all in the aim of creating a website that is: 

1. Easy to use and navigate
2. Attractive and eye catching to all users without overloading senses
3. Information is easy to see and gather without having trouble finding particular things you want to see
4. Make the website engaging for the user 

I achieved this by laying out and setting some user stories and experiences that I think are vital to the website creation. They are as followed:

* A user needs to be able to navigate the page easy without using browser controls.
  * It is vital to a good page, I wanted the user to be able to use my own coding to go from page to page without feeling the need to use the browser
  controls, adding to the UX design of the page.
  * This is achieved by adding a fixed navbar at the top of the page that is always present .

* A user needs to be able to find the information they want easily.
  * Someone should never have to look that hard to find certain information that they might want, work history, skills etc. 
  * I achieved this by creating a very minimalist layout to the website, a lot of white space with different sections of the website clearly defined.

* A user should be able to engage with the website to control and keep their focus.
  * If the person viewing your website loses interest or focus beacuse there are walls of text in front of them that they don't really want to read
  then you have failed to capture that persons attention. By adding more information in interesting ways and buttons that the person needs to 
  navigate this will capture their focus.
  * This is achieved by using bar graphs, small paragraphs of text to say things and interesting layouts that shouldn't get boring.

* A user needs to be able to see my skill set.
  * Potential employers and collaboraters need to be able to gauge what sort of developer and worker I am. What skills I have and what I may need work
  in to fit what they need. 
  * This is shown in the bar graph on the about page (filled out with fake percentages to show coding ability nothing more).

* A user should be able to see what experience I have in the industry.
  * Another major factor in my opinion on what people will be looking at to hire me is where I have worked. This needs to be shown in an easy mannor.
  * Achieved by a simple timeline at the bottom of the about page.

* A user should be able to also see what work I have created before, projects etc.
  * Much like work experiece at jobs, another form of work experiece is simply what websites I have created or been apart of.
  * Achieved on the Portfolio page by relaying some of the biggest work I have been apart of, then also all of the other websites I have created below 
  it. (All websites are placeholders and shouldn't be taken as serious websites I have created)

* A user needs to be able to contact me in a proffessional manner.
  * Outside of social media there needs to be somewhere that a potential empolyer or client can email me to show offers etc.
  * Achieved in the sole contact page, a small page dedicated to saying "Just email me!!!".

All of these user stories that I briefly layed out at the start of the project for myself made it easier to control what I did and didn't need to 
show in my website. It allowed me to focus in on certain things more than others, and also not miss anything I thought was important from the website.

Along with this, I also created a wireframe in Balsamic which can be viewed here: https://balsamiq.cloud/sq84rm3/pp6h0o7

## Features

I will go through all of the features of my website page by page below under destinct headings.

### Sitewide

#### Existing Features

* Navigation bar 
  * Allows the user to use my custom navbar to go through all the pages easily rather than using the brower controls. 
  * Also has all of my social media accounts linked incase any one wants to get more involed or see my online pressence.
* Footer
  * This has my name again with a copyright sign and also a link to download a CV if needed. While what goes on the footer I found less important for 
  the user 

#### Features that could be implemented

* Button that redirects to the top of the page if scrolled down
* Change the layout of the website to a scrolling vertical website.
  * I believe for this sort of page and its goal, a scrolling website would be more visually appealing and seem larger.

### Home Page (index.html)

#### Existing Features

* Simple large design of background and text with my name and what I do for a job.  
  * Allows users to immediately see what page they have clicked on, who I am and what I do. 
* Button that allows the user to enter the site.
  * Allows users to engage with the page by pressing a button, feels like they are entering something exclusive or almost openeing a 
  curtain into my life.

#### Features that could be implemented

* Background for the page is an animation, to capture the users eye a little more.
  * Makes the user more impressed possibly. That has never hurt anyone.
* Animate the text to drop or sweep in from the left.
  * Again showcases more of my skills once I knew how to do it. Also is a great design choice in my opinion.

### About Page (about.html)

#### Existing Features

* Small picture of myself to show people what I look like and gender.
* Two paragraphs with room for more just explaining who I am and what I can do.
  * Allows uesrs to see a little into who I am in a consice manner.
* Bar chart showing off my skillset.
  * Allows the user to see what skills I have, what I lack training in etc.
* A timeline of my work history and positions.

#### Features that could be implemented

* Two to four of my strongest skills shown by a icon inside a coloured box with a description 
  * Something like: Responsiveness is my highest priority for my websites so they can work on every platform and size etc.
* A slideshow of more photos from my social medias
  * To create a more engaging and attractive look to my page, with more than just a single photo of myself, also a good way to get people engaging 
  with my social media if each photo links to particular pages they were posted etc.
* Could also have a timeline next to my work history that included education.

### Portfolio Page (portfolio.html)

#### Existing Features

* Carousel of images showing off my biggest three websites I have worked on
  * Each has a button that links to the page in action so they user can see the page.
* Smaller cards below to show off the complete range of websites that I have worked on, with the possibility to be infinite cards.
  * Cards have buttons that redirect to the actual page online so they can see it in action and explore my work.

#### Features that could be implemented

* Redesign the smaller cards to have a modal when clicked on that offers a larger portion of information of the page, what languages were used 
to create it etc.
* Redesign the cards to link to a hidden section within the website that each has it's own dedicated page to show off design process, like this readme
for my whole project. 
* Could include a link to my github page or any other hosting of code I have completed.

### Contact Page (contact.html)

#### Existing Features

* A form that allows the user to complete and send me an email if they want to get into touch regarding a job or project they would want to work 
on with me.
  * Allows users to achieve contacting me using a form that they can submit.

## Technologies used

* CSS3
  * This project uses CSS3 to style and create a more dynamic UX design.

* HTML5
  * This project uses HTML5 to create the base framework for the whole website.

* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
  * I used Bootstrap to style and create a more responsive website using their built in content.

* [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
  * Font Awesome was used to add icons to some of my features and create a more attractive website.

* [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
  * The fonts on this website were all procured fron google fonts.

* [Hover.css](https://ianlunn.github.io/Hover/)
  * The hover.css libary was used to style the hover function of my buttons.

* [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)
  * I used the immense libary of W3Schools website to learn and refresh my mind on anything CSS or HTML related that I needed to implement features
  onto my site.

* [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/)
  * During the planning phase I used Balsamiq to create a wireframe of what I wanted my project to look like.

## Testing

In this section I will go over all of the ways I tested my site to assure that it works up to a high standard. Starting with my user stories:

1. Navbar
   1. Go to the "About" page
   2. Click on every available navigation link that is present to verify all links work correctly
   3. Click on the social media links, make sure they open in a new page and go to the correct location
   4. Repeat for each of the other pages, "Portfolio" "Contact"

2. Buttons (Engagement)
   1. Go to the "Home" page
   2. Click the button, check that it takes you to the correct location "About"
   3. Go to the "Portfolio" page
   4. Click on each button to ensure it links to the correct location outside of the website in a new browser
   5. While doing this process make sure that the styles are being applied correctly, each button presents user with a pointer cursor when hovered.
   Also that the appropiate background color is changed for each button

3. Contact form
   1. Go to the "Contact" page
   2. Try to submit an empty form, to make sure an error is produced about required fields
   3. Try to submit a name with numbers in, to make sure an error is produced about what characters can be used
   4. Try to submit an email without the @ sign so a relevant error message appears
   5. Try to submit with name and email correct but no message in the final field, make sure appropiate error is produced
   6. Try to submit with all fields filled out correctly, check that message disappears and form is sent

4. Responsiveness
   1. Go to the "Home" page
   2. Inspect page element opening up chrome dev tools
   3. Toggle "Device Toolbar" (CTRL + SHIFT + M) 
   4. Go through each device possible from Galaxy S5 to Ipad Pro to make sure that the website scales properly on each viewport and all content
   is still visible and styled correctly
   5. Repeat for each page in the website, "About", "Portfolio" and "Contact"
   6. Do this after each time a new feature is added into the website to ensure consistency

5. Footer
   1. Go to the "About" page
   2. Scroll down to the footer and click on the download icon for my cv, check that it opens a new tab with the example cv inside
   3. Repeat for each of the other pages, "Portfolio" and "Contact"

Regarding the responsiveness of my website on other browsers and sizes of viewport I conducted some in-house tests using my family and partner, 
along with the tests that I was already conducting myself. I got my partner as she has a mac-book to try the website on Safari and complete the same 
tests that I conducted. Reducing the size of the browser without using dev tools. No issues there. I also had my parents try the website from their 
Iphones by sending them the link once I had pushed the website to Github. They then tried to find any issues with the website, anything that looked 
un-neat etc. As a side note I also installed a view different browsers onto my computer, one being opera, vivaldi, internet explorer and firefox to test 
what it looked like on those browsers as well. I am confident it is responsive and up to a high standard of scaling when using smaller devices.

## Deployment

To depoly the finished work to Github I had to push all of my current commitments made to the git repository I had created at the start of the project.

In detail the process was:

1. Open a new terminal in Gitpod
2. Check the status of the current workspace by typing "git status" 
3. Make sure all files that haven't been added to the repository are added using "git add ." or specific pages instead of the "."
4. Commit any files to the repository to finalise them using "git commit -m "..." with "..." being a description of what the changes were made 
before the last commitment
5. Then finally write "git push" to push the latest commitment to the github page 
6. From there go to Github and select my current project
7. Locate the settings and scroll down to Github Pages, select the master branch under source and wait for your website to go live


## Credits

Reference: All the images are taken from a website called BlueSnap, from this article: https://home.bluesnap.com/snap-center/blog/ecommerce-website-examples/
I wanted to find some smaller sized images of websites I could use as placeholders as I don't have any real websites I've worked on. While searching
I realised I didn't need smaller images, just .png's as they are resizable. I stumbled upon this website which was perfect, had loads of good .png 
images and all real websites. No more thought than that. But they were a godsend.
